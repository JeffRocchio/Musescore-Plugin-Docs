This is a guide for the MuseScore 3.0 plugin implementation.

## Documentation

Full featured documentation is available in [Doxygen format](https://musescore.github.io/MuseScore_PluginAPI_Docs/plugins/html/index.html).

## Converting MuseScore 2 plugins
Almost all of the needed changes can also be made automatically with [this converter script](https://github.com/dmitrio95/mscorepluginconverter) (Python is needed to run it).

A detailed set of porting instructions can be found at [html/plugin2to3.html](https://musescore.github.io/MuseScore_PluginAPI_Docs/plugins/html/plugin2to3.html)

## Properties
This is a partial list of properties available for elements. An automatic documentation is not available currently and will be finished later. You can also find out all available elements' properties using
```console.log(Object.keys(element));```
which will print a list of properties names if launched in Plugin Creator window.
